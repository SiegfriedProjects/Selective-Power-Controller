# Selective-Power-Controller

In modern LTE networks, shutdown often results in use of a backup power supply that uses batteries to power on every technology on the base station which includes 3G and 2G technology. Although useful, this backup power is inefficient. In the event of a hurricane or any form of setback leading to a network shutdown, this backup power supply does not allow the station to run very long. The fix is to make the backup power supply selective, so that priority is given to the technologies that will allow people to stay in touch and allow energy to be conserved and maintained for a longer amount of time. The relay module boxes allow this to happen. Using a specifically designed PCB board, SubGhz connected microcontrollers powered by lithium ion batteries, and an LCD display screen for the user, a selective power controller will be made to shut down technologies when power drops below the normal threshold.
